Although there is continuous production of products, the dataset reveals significant issues:

- Some products are manufactured but do not get sold.
- There are significant delays in the delivery of certain categories.
- Profits came to a complete halt in 2018 despite ongoing production.

The main problem is the **inefficient management of supply and inventory** along with **weak demand forecasting**, which ultimately impacts profitability and overall operational efficiency.
